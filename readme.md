# Proof-of-Attendance NFTs

## Project Title
**Proof-of-Attendance NFTs**

## Project Description
The **Proof-of-Attendance NFTs** project provides a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable method for event organizers to issue NFTs as proof of attendance. Each attendee at an event receives a unique NFT that serves as a digital certificate or badge for participation. This system ensures that event attendance is verifiable on the blockchain, offering a novel way to track and reward participation, while also providing a collectible or memento for attendees.

The contract allows event creation, attendance tracking, and NFT minting. Each event has a set date, and only participants who attend the event receive a Proof-of-Attendance NFT. Events can be marked as closed once they are finished, preventing further participation.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **Proof-of-Attendance NFTs** project is to enable event organizers to engage participants in new ways, utilizing blockchain technology to issue collectible proof of attendance. These NFTs can be used as digital memorabilia, qualifications, or as part of loyalty programs. With the goal of increasing transparency, gamification, and providing real-time verifiable proof, this project empowers both attendees and event organizers.

## Key Features
- **Event Creation**: Event organizers can create events by specifying the name, date, and base URI for the NFT.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Event organizers can mark attendance for individual attendees and track whether they have received their Proof-of-Attendance NFT.
- **Minting NFTs**: NFTs are minted for each attendee when their attendance is marked, with a unique token ID linked to the event.
- **Event Closure**: Once an event concludes, it can be closed to prevent further attendance.
- **Batch Attendance**: Organizers can mark attendance for multiple attendees in a batch operation, saving time for larger events.
- **Verifiable Proof**: Each NFT is a verifiable proof of attendance stored on the blockchain, ensuring that participation cannot be tampered with.
- **Event Data**: The contract allows organizers and attendees to view event details and check attendance status for each participant.
